# ExplainToMe

`explaintome.py` is a Python script that uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo API to generate an explanation of the code. It reads code from a file provided as a command line argument, sends that code to the OpenAI API, and prints the generated explanation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenAI Python package (can be installed via `pip install openai`)

## Setting Up OpenAI Developer Account and API Key

1. Visit the OpenAI website at [https://www.openai.com/](https://www.openai.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button and create an account.
3. After verifying your email address and logging in, navigate to the API section.
4. In the API section, you will find your API key. Copy this key and keep it safe; you'll need it for the next step.

## Usage

1. Replace `'your-api-key'` in the script with the API key obtained from the OpenAI website.
2. Save the script to a file named `explaintome.py`.
3. Run the script from the command line with a filename as an argument: `python explaintome.py [name of file]`. Replace `[name of file]` with the path to the file you want to explain.
4. The script will print an explanation of the code to the console.

## Disclaimer

The OpenAI GPT-3.5 model is a powerful tool but it is not infallible. It may not always generate a perfect explanation, particularly for complex or poorly written code. Always review the generated explanations and use your own judgement.
